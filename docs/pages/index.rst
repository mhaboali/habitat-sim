Habitat Simulator
#################

A flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, multiple
sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling (with built-in support for
MatterPort3D, Gibson, Replica, and other datasets).

When rendering a scene from the Matterport3D dataset, *Habitat-Sim* achieves
several thousand frames per second (FPS) running single-threaded, and reaches
over 10,000 FPS multi-process on a single GPU!
